The Projects, together some 1,595km2, are located south of Rolleston, approximately 50 and 30 kilometres respectively from the Queensland Gas Pipeline and interconnected east coast gas network. Neither project is restricted by domestic gas reservation requirements. State Gas intends to accelerate commercialisation of the conventional gas assets in Reid&#39;s Dome through the implementation of an innovative virtual pipeline solution which will see the Company transport gas by truck to a closely located inlet point on existing pipeline infrastructure. State Gas also holds a 35% interest in new permit ATP 2068 in joint venture with Santos QNT Pty Ltd (65%), and, also in the same joint venture, has been appointed Preferred Tenderer for an additional new exploration block PLR2021-1-3.
